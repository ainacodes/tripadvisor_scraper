The waiter was pleasant at first but when he realised we wanted the special offer menu & no wine (we are not wine drinkers) he changed & became quite offhand we had to call him back to order drinks! He also began an argument with a lady on the next table over which drink she had ordered he was shouting at her saying that is what you ordered! Rude! Each course was placed in front of us without a word, each course came quickly & the whole experience felt really rushed (we were in the restaurant for 1hour 15 mins from being seated to eat a 3 course meal).  The food however was outstanding Fillet Mignon cooked perfectly & tasted delicious - before we had finished eating dessert the bill was placed on our table without a word so we paid & left.

The place has an impressive meat cave at the entrance, and the interior has been tastefully restored to its 20's exact style. The place was very crowded and noisy on a Sunday evening. We had a drink at its lovely bar where we were very efficiently and nicely treated. We then had amazing ribeye steaks - you could almost call them a Tomahawk, cooked to perfection and with a size that makes the $56 they cost almost good value for money. Garlic spinach and fries were aboundantly provided as side dishes. And the waiter was fast to bring me the Dijon mustard I had requested. No deserts as we were so full. Very good historical place, true to New York style and character.Read more","February 15, 2020"

I hadn't eaten at Gallaghers for maybe 15 years and was pleased to try it again. I ordered the French Onion soup which was fantastic.. excellent, rich broth, filled with onions, nice large crouton and tons of cheese. A very nice soup. I also ordered a prime rib, thinking this would be a restaurant to give Smith & Wollensky a run for the money. Not even close. The cut that came out was an ""English Cut"" at best, maybe 3/4"" thick, perfectly medium rare until I cut it to discover.. it was cold. Not warm like medium rare, but cold like it had been sitting on a plate for 20 minutes since my soup had come out. I asked the waiter about it and the maitre'd was there at the same time who told me ""well, you ordered it medium rare"".. I was so shocked I asked ""are you saying I don't know the difference between COLD and medium rare?"" He said he'd be right back and he returned with my same prime rib placed under a salamander for maybe 30 seconds. I was so stunned, I just ate the steak which was a prime cut, but thin, no great dry aged flavor and nothing to write home about. The waiter apologized and otherwise, service was great. But, I was just disappointed in the response, the treatment of what should have been a flagship cut of prime rib and questioning a patron. I might go back, but if the steaks are like this, I think I'll stick with their cross town rivals.Read more","January 10, 2020"

Five of us went recently and had a great time.  All good NY steakhouses serve high quality beef so the difference comes down to things like service, atmosphere, and how they do everything else on the menu.  Gallaghers keeps their menu short on purpose.  They want the things they do serve to be special.  The raw bar and appetizers are special.  Try the clams casino, salmon tartare, crab meat cocktail and, for a real treat, the shrimp and lobster dumplings. If you don't want beef, the veal chop is an excellent choice. Sides are all good but make sure to try their mac n cheese - its worth it.
Gallagers has a very classic and inviting feel.  They put a lot of people in a relatively small space but it doesn't have that crowded feel. As for service, If you're going to a NYC steakhouse part of the experience is the brusque waiters.  As long as they're attentive and helpful with the menu, its all good. Gallaghers waitstaff is no different, but they're not rude like some places I've been. Hint, don't go in the 5-6 pm timeframe - they will push you along.  Go after 7pm and you'll feel less rushed.Read more","January 26, 2020"

We had booked and glad we did as it was very busy and very crammed. It felt quite impersonal as the tables are within inches of each other. We ordered a medium rib eye steak to share due to the size of it. We were quite surprised to find any veg or sides were extras, would have expected these to be included due to the price of the steaks. When our steak arrived it was very much more rare than medium, so much so that it was oozing blood. I explained to the waiter (after trying several times to get his attention but he was taken with a table of women) that this wasn’t what we ordered and he agreed and took it back to the kitchen. When he returned with it, it was done to perfection and melted in our mouth. Overall all it was a gorgeous steak but over priced, the setting would be much better if the tables weren’t placed within inches of each other. Been once, not sure we’d return.

Last night was a disaster.  We went to the restaurant 45 minutes ahead of our reservation, checked in and we were told that we could be seated early but. not yet.  My husband and I sat at the bar and had a couple of drinks and we ordered an appetizer.  We were called to our table 10 minutes prior to our reservation time.  Once we got to the table we both immediately ordered another drink and the waiter left, finally returning with our drinks and left again, this time he did deposit the menus.  We looked at the menu and when the waiter returned he said do you want to place your order?  We did.  The waiter never told us about any specials and never mentioned what the fish selection was for the night.  After being seated at the table for 50 minutes, we received our salads, the waiter said sorry it was so slow, we told him we were going to a show and at this time we only had a half hour before we needed to leave.  Ten minutes later our meals came, at which time we told him we needed the check.  He returned with the check and we needed to have our dinners boxed so we could get to the show.  We left at 7:48 pm, dinners now in a to go box.  Really-we were we left with no food for 50 minutes?  So badly disappointed that I do not believe we will be returning...ever.  Also, last night I emailed the manager and explained why I was upset and disappointed.  I figured I would give him time to explain prior to posting this review.  As of this time 6:20 pm I have not gotten a response to the email, therefore I have now posted this review.Read more","March 1, 2020"

You have a choice of soup or salad, an entree and dessert. And the food is very good. 

To begin you have a choice of a soup like clam chowder or a salad such as a Caesar or a Wedge. There were four of us and each chose a salad.  For the main course I opted for the sliced Filet Mignon that was served, as I ordered it, rare with carmelized onions, my wife chose the Chicken Paillard that was pounded to perfection while one friend went for the Scottish Salmon and the other selected Lamb Chops. Everyone was very pleased. 

The dessert choices were Cheesecake, Key Lime Pie and ice cream. We tried all three and they were all wonderful. 

Our server was a real New York pro who was very accommodating and very funny. 

Gallagher's has an old school feel to it from the wood and brass bar (see photo) to the old style urinal in the men's room (photo).

We had the lunch $29 dollar menu. We were originally going to have 2 courses but were told we could only have a starter and main when we would have liked the main and dessert. I didn’t really enjoy my wedge salad but my daughter enjoyed her garden salad. Her steak was fine but I asked for mine with no blood. I could tell the waiter didn’t agree with my choice. When it arrived it was medium rare. Front of house came over immediately and told the waiter to change it. It came back on the burnt side which was unnecessary as you can still cook steak so it’s tender but no blood. We had a side of onion rings that were huge for 2 people. We chose the American cheesecake for dessert and it was delicious. We were then given a board of fruits from the Front  of House because I had sent my steak back. 
I enjoyed my meal but would still have been happy with main and dessert. The waiters are very attentive but could have listened more. We booked online and were seated immediately. The restaurant had a good vibe to it.Read more","February 10, 2020"

I agree with other reviews that there are lots of tables close to each other so you lose the intimacy but the atmosphere outweighs that.

Just be warned - take the price of the side dishes as a guide to the size of them. Each side we had (sweet potato mash, onions, mushrooms, sprouts) meant we had enough food for 6! Just pick a couple of sides and share.

A nice touch was a small cake to wish us happy anniversary too.

Onion rings. 

Dinner came out and the waiter asked us to cut the meat in half to make sure it was cooked to our liking. The colour was perfect. Please not if you like to dish your sides onto your own plate this is not a restaurant for you from start to finish the waiters come by and pick up your sides bowls and start loading it on your plate so your buggered if you don‚Äôt like something and as they just keep piling it on. 
We explained to the waiter that the steak we ordered was wasn‚Äôt the correct one as we ordered the bone sirloin he confirmed he didn‚Äôt understand and had given us just the sirloin he then started clearing out plates muttering he will get the manager. The manager attended and basically offered us a bowl of fruit we declined and said it was fine no problems. Within seconds we then got the bill slammed on our table then the card machine out i front of us so I guess we was being kicked out lol. The bill came to yes wait for it $205 they have even charged us for the complimentary bread and water  when putting my card in the waiter took it and handed the machine back with a total of $250 so yes he had out $45 tip on for himself.

It was our first evening of our birthday trip to NYC (first time ever in the US!) and Gallagher's was the first restaurant of the trip. We'd heard amazing things so were very much looking forward to it.

Whilst we waited for our table, we had a drink at the bar. The bar and interior design of the restaurant is lovely and very elegant. The bar staff were a joy also.

We were shown to our table, which was a bit of a squeeze, in the back corner of the restaurant. We were given some bread and offered water which was great. As we were both quite tired and we only ordered mains and sides: the New York sirloin and the fillet mignon with fries and mushrooms. We were sat at our table for 18:30 and ordered around 18:40. However, at 19:30 our waiter came over to apologise and said he had 'lost our order' and therefore it hasn't gone through to the kitchen, We were of course quite gutted, but accepted the apologies as these things can happen anywhere and reordered again. 19:50 was when we were thinking we might have to get up and leave as by this point, we'd been sat for almost an hour and half and felt as though we were being ignored. at 20:00 both our steaks and the sides came to the table - however, there was no apology for the delay from the waiter.

The food was delicious. Honestly absolutely faultless. Both steaks were deliciously juicy and cooked to perfection. The only problem was, as we had waited so long I wasn't as hungry anymore and had started feeling sick so I couldn't manage my fries.

As we were quite disappointed by the service we had received, we thought we might have had some compensation with regards to the bill. Nope. We were charged $160 + tips. When I only gave $10 on top of the $160 the waiter challenged my partner and he ended up giving another $10. I was quite disappointed by this as we had heard such incredible things and whilst the food was indeed amazing, we felt quite let down by the service from our waiter.

Everyone else we met that evening was absolutely lovely and a delight. The food was spectacular. We would still re-visit despite the incident however, I think it is right that Gallagher's are aware of this feedback reasons.Read more","December 17, 2021"

We went for lunch on Valentines Day because of prior recommendation. We chose from the 3 course lunch menu. I had clam chowder which was my first time eating. Wow, it was just gorgeous. My husband had soup of the day - split pea which again was delicious. We both had the 10oz upgrade filet mignon for entree. Omg! It just melted in the mouth and was cooked to perfection. You also get some special steak sauce to try. This is also yummy. Desert was New York cheesecake and Key Lime Pie. I couldn‚Äôt actually eat all mine as I was so full. We had 2 drinks and 2 lattes and the bill was just over $100. Spectacular value in NYC.
We loved it so much that we returned the following day having almost the same again but not the filet mignon upgrade to 10oz, just the one from the menu. No drinks today as the tap water is cold and plentiful. The bill was only $58. I cannot recommend eating here enough.Read more","February 16, 2020"

We visited from the UK for my wife‚Äôs birthday. I emailed to the Gallaghers ahead of time to see if they could do anything special for her and they sure did. The whole experience from start to finish was excellent and really enjoyable. The setting is amazing. It still has the traditional 1920‚Äôs feel from when it opened and the staff are dressed in suits and ties for a really traditional and professional look. We were served by Alberto and another gentleman (who‚Äôs name has unfortunately slipped my mind) Alberto has worked there for 37 years and clearly enjoys his job. They both advised us on food choices and what wine would go well with what meal. We had had a porterhouse steak for two and it was hand cut and served to us along with a fantastic glass of red wine. We were not pressured into anything and Alberto and his colleague made jokes as they passed our table to keep us chuckling and laughing though out our meal. To top it of Gallaghers supplied a small cake for the birthday girl free of charge along with the singing waiters. It really was a lovely meal and I can hand on heart say it was the best steak I‚Äôve ever had‚Ä¶. And I‚Äôve eaten a lot of steak. Now if you‚Äôre looking for a cheap steak that you can moan to your friends about then don‚Äôt go here. You absolutely get what you pay for. It‚Äôs not the cheapest but it‚Äôs absolutely fantastic. Why would you scrimp and a good steak anyway? We had a shared lobster starter, Porterhouse steak for two, fries, giant asparagus, desert to share, two glasses of wine and two cocktails. $230.The food was great, the service was great and the setting is great.

It was a wet and cold evening so the warm glow of Gallagher's was welcome. The interior of the bar/restaurant is very atmospheric with photographs festooned around the walls and the historic interest of the place was clear for all to see, epitomised by the visible meat room as you enter. We were given a nice table and our waiter was very attentive even though some of his colleagues were clearly irritated when we complained about the watery Clam Chowder which was tasteless, having evidence of carrots but little clam content. It all went back and in fairness, was deducted from the bill but it is not something I would recommend. By contrast, the main course was very good indeed. I ordered a 14 ounces fillet steak with blue cheese crust cooked medium. My wife and I wanted to share it and this was not a problem. If anything, it was a little undercooked for our liking rather than being pink, but it was very good. The star of the show for me was the side dishes. We ordered a side of Creamed Spinach at 16 dollars and a portion of Saut√©ed mushroom also at 16 dollars. Each side could have fed 4 people! The spinach was wonderful and I could have eaten a bowl as my meal and the mushrooms were also excellent. We managed to find a good bottle of Southern French rose that was dry and light pink as we like it and at 55 dollars a bottle, by New York standards it was good value. We had a very enjoyable evening and even though expensive, we felt it reasonable value for an old world steakhouse in the centre of New York/Times Square.Read more","October 4, 2022"

I enjoyed the atmosphere at Gallaghers (dry age room as you walk in is a nice touch) but the food should be much better for what you pay for. We had clams casino for an appetizer and they were great. They provide bread and butter with flake salt on top. These two items were the highlight of the meal, which is unacceptable for a famous steakhouse. I ordered the ribsteak, which is a ribeye, that was good but not great. We got mac and cheese and creamed spinach, accidentally, for sides. The mac and cheese was recommended by the waiter but resembled the likes I would find at a school cafeteria (stay away). When we ordered the sides, we said we wanted broccoli. The waiter misheard us and said we wanted the creamed spinach inquisitively. We corrected him and told him again we wanted broccoli. I guess he didn't hear us the second time and still brought us creamed spinach. The creamed spinach was not bad and definitely a lot better than the mac and cheese. I wouldn't come back here and waste my money. Plenty of other steakhouses in this area. If you are in Brooklyn, I can recommend Amber Steak house and their bone-in ribeye.Read more","August 9, 2022"

Incorrect drink delivered and charged for. Only realised when  reordering  a second glass and the waiter asked if I'd prefer to stay on the wrong wine rather than what I asked for. 
The steak was unfortunately not cooked as requested. It was busy and the waiter never checked back after our food was delivered.  By the time there was an opportunity, it was too late and plates were being cleared from the table. I could have said something but in honesty, appetite had passed but the large piece of uncooked meat left in the middle of the plate should  have been enough of a clue. I was underwhelmed by the service and the waiter clearly wasn't happy that I wouldn't select the 18%+ tip option. I opted for $25 which was still quite generous despite the lack of service. The receipt was thrown down on the table,  not handed back which pretty much sums up the service.

Still, I wanted a famous steakhouse experience and my sisters were happy to indulge.  The waiters could not have been more accommodating.  Our mutual experiences in dining have shown that we all often want to order the same thing (perhaps it's genetic), but if we order a full entree each, it's just way too much food...and who wants to carry a doggybag back to a hotel?  The staff gleefuly let us split two entrees and we agreed (as we often do) on the sides, sharing one Wedge salad and an order of sauteed mushrooms, served family style.

While we were told the specials, it certainly wasn‚Äôt the same detail and time he gave our neighbors.  Our sides were lukewarm, steak was okay, French onion broth delicious, but the amount of cheese was a lot and trying to spoon into it, lost a good amount of broth to the saucer.  

We had a salad and soup appetizer, NY strip and filet, Lyonnaise potatoes and broccoli, and two glasses of wine a piece.

Great atmosphere when we walked in, but a bit of a cramped table. Never mind we were there for the steak! Although when a couple were seated next to us, they were so close that their waiter had to lean over our table to serve them.

Firstly the waiter brought the wrong drinks, no problem to change them but then he spilt my husband's and just left it. Steaks came out promptly and were fantastic so we were delighted. Then the desserts came out and before we finished eating, the waiter brought the bill and just said ""I'll leave this for you"" . We weren't asked if we wanted another drink (we did!) as the bill had already been processed. I felt so rushed that I asked if we were on a timed slot and needed to get out? The waiter laughed and said no but that's not how we felt. We decided to just pay and go which left a bit of a bad feeling as we had wanted another cocktail. As I looked at the bill, the card machine appeared although I still hadn't finished my dessert or drink. I was informed gratuity not included and I said yes I can see that. Then as the payment processed I was reminded that gratuity not included. I pay by card but tip in cash so wasn't an issue. Then as we left to speak to the maitre d, the waiter shouted across the restaurant ""so you're not gonna tip us?"" at which point the $20 note went back in my purse....

We spoke to the maitre d who told us how wonderful Gallaghers was and what a great reputation they have. Of course I agreed and that's precisely why we'd chosen there! However on this occasion the rudeness of the waiter totally ruined what had been a lovely evening. The maitre d apologised but the damage was done.

The wedge was very fresh with a creamy blue cheese dressing and crumbled blue cheese and the dumplings were delicious with a soy ginger dipping sauce.

Great meal, carpaccio and salmon tartare to start, rib eye steak and fillet for main. We weren’t told that there was a specials menu which I would have ordered from (8oz fillet rather than 10oz). We only knew about it as we overheard the table next to us being told what they were.  When we asked the waiter about it he wasn’t happy we weren’t told about them and gave us a complimentary fruit platter, which was a nice gesture but I would have preferred them to ask if they could offer a dessert on the house (all the same price including the fruit platter). My husband ordered the pecan pie with ice cream which should have been hot but was cold.

We were a little late getting out of the hotel, not thinking about rush-hour, there was no way we were going to get a cab, so we had to make it 17 blocks in about a 15 minute window. without stoplights and other people on the sidewalk, we probably would have made it in time, but we were running late. I called, James answered, I asked if he would please hold my reservation. He said that he would. We were still running behind, and I called back to be sure James was still going to hold my reservation since we were 15 minutes late. Thankfully, he did. I really appreciated that!!

The restaurant itself is really nice, high end. It was super crowded. We were seated at a small table in between two other couples, it was cramped. I was so happy to be there, I did not worry about rubbing elbows with strangers. It is also quite loud. This is not a quiet candlelight dinner spot if that’s what you are looking for. 

The service was wonderful, quick, efficient, and very friendly. We had two mixed drinks to start, for the meal I had a sirloin steak, he had the surf and turf with a filet and lobster tail. We had Caesar salad, mashed potatoes, and spinach. We also had a glass of Shiraz with the dinner.

Everything was so outstanding. I like my steaks medium well, the steak that was brought to me was medium rare at best. Normally, I would have sent it back, but it tasted good, i did not. I did only eat half of it because the closer I got to the center, the more rare it was.
I do not know how they make their mashed potatoes, but they were the best ones I’ve ever had. The sautéed spinach was also quite delicious.

We did not finish our food, there was just so much of it! I did mention to the waiter that it was my boyfriends birthday, and he brought out a small chocolate cake. Even though we were too full  to eat another bite, we ate the whole cake. It was so delicious.

The deserts were something else - absolutely huge. For us, we struggled with 2 courses. The bill wasn't cheap but, upon reflection, it was absolutely worth every dollar. Outstanding. If we ever go back to NYC, Gallaghers is a ""Must Do"" again.Read more","June 9, 2022"

We dined early (5.30pm) as we had The Lion King booked down the road (Mishkov is about 10 minutes walk through Times Square from here).
The Dr Loosen Blue riesling by the glass is lovely.  So is the Zardetto Prosecco.  We had 3 Poterhouses to share between 3 adults and it was way too much food!  We should have ordered 2 but never learn!  Too much food but what great quality and perfectly cooked.  Medium Rare is Rare to our UK pallets but was fine for me!
Our party also had the 10oz Filet and the Salmon which were also great.
The onion rings are exceptional.  Cauliflower and Mac and cheese also very good.  The service here is more formal than many places we went in NY subsequently but I guess that's what you should expect.

Intimidating serving staff.,"Where to begin with this one. As soon as you walk through the door, you know the belt is already being unbuckled. This was with hindsight. To get to the point the service started okay. A little fake and rehearsed but okay. Starter was great. Steak was average at best. Lukewarm to cold. Sides were average. Drinks not of a sufficient standard. Guinness was poor. The real fun started when the bill arrived. Bill was 474 between the 4 of us. A decent spend, we thought.  Tip time, not happy. This is when the real aggression started. We left what we thought was a suitable cash tip for 1 hours service. Server not happy. Informed head honcho. He wasn't happy. Wanted to know why we were not leaving a 78 dollar tip. The reason was is the fact we do not believe in entitlement. Servers do not earn 78 dollars an hour and seeing as the food was average, we thought what we had left was more than enough. To sum up. Find somewhere else to spend your hard earned. This place was recommended to us. Very disappointed. All in all the experience left an extremely nasty taste in our mouths.Read more","February 12, 2023"

It is expensive and perhaps because we go out to eat steak alot, we have ruined it for ourselves a bit, because although the food was delicious and we had a great time, we didn’t feel it was worth the amount we spent comparing it to where we usually eat steak for much less. 
We really did enjoy our food though, we had pork belly special and crab cocktail to start, porterhouse for two for mains with French fries and we also had key lime pie and NY cheesecake to finish. 
We overindulged and it was a wonderful night but definitely in the high price bracket.
Our waiters were friendly, helpful and prompt. It was a good vibe.

I would also say that a definite highlight of our visit was the really fun conversation we had with diners around us. We were there for my partner's 40th birthday and I also appreciated them spontaneously presenting her with a chocolate cake and candle - a really nice touch!

It was quite expensive (partly due to the weak pound at the moment) but overall I am happy that we came. The only suggestion I would make to the restaurant would be to offer smaller portion sizes for all the sides. They were all really huge portions and quite expensive too, so it was a shame that we left at least half of all of them. We were warned about the portion sizes being large when ordering them, but i'm someone who likes some salad or vegetables with my steak rather than just having it on its own with french fries.

I came to New York City to celebrate my 40th birthday and we were staying at the M Social Hotel. Gallagher’s is next door and located in the Times Square area.

We pre-booked via their website a few weeks in advance following research and reviews we’d read.  Booking in advance was a good shout given they were almost packed out on a Wednesday night!

There was a laid back feel, vibrant ambience with  jazz music in the background. It felt instantly familiar even though we’ve never visited before.

Our waiter Robert (and another chap whose name I can’t remember) were really friendly, chatty and attentive and had a good knowledge of the specials and the menu. 

It’s quite pricy - a meal for 2 was about £440 including gratuity but you get what you pay for. The steaks were huge (more than we could manage) and side dishes can certainly cater for 2 people so less is more in that regard!

We would definitely recommend this place to all steak lovers! Won’t forget this place in a hurry!

The service was slow. When the waiter finally arrived with water after being seated for almost 10 minutes he complained that his helper was in a meeting and management scheduled meetings at the worst time. Not sure if it was management or the helper because we never laid eyes or had anyone visit the table except for our server, and he was missing more than available. We were out of water 3x and even after a neighboring server was filling glasses 12 inches away, we had to ask for a refill.

The steak, a sirloin, was big and thick and flavorless. The salad not memorable and the lyonnaise potato dish greasy. The drinks were ok, but again, nothing to write home about!

You definitely need to like you meet and you should recognise that this is classic restaurant so the potato mash is comes with butter. The vegetable side dishes are likely to have been made with oil and someone and so on.

Although I’m sure people located to, I think you would struggle if you were gluten intolerant dairy intolerant or vegan to get a meal here so be warned . It’s a steak house.

We did get the sense that this was possibly a tourist attraction. The weight staff were professional but indifferent . The meal was excellent quality and highly recommended. The standard serving signs for a sirloin steak $57 is 16 ounces which translates to 500 g in metric before it is cooked. It is a big piece of meat.

We had the side dishes of broccolini. potato mash, jumbo shrimp that were genuinely jumbo as well as the sirloin steak and the tota came to $165 including tip . Recommend as a once in a Lifetime experience but not as a regular thingRead more","April 9, 2024"

I visited in October and had a reservation for 1 at 8:30 pm. I came at 8:30 and was told to wait around the bar for my table. The bar was full at this time and it would be hard to order without disturbing the guests sitting there,  no waiter came and asked if I wanted a drink. I waited for my table (booked at 8:30) for one hour, and at 9:30 I was asked if I would like to sit at the bar or a table. Being alone, bar would have been fine if they asked earlier, but I said it was what ever at this point as I was already boiling inside. I was then seated at a table.

The waiters at the table have the old-school service you expect from a place like this, and the waiters themself are rather old. Nothing wrong with that itself at all though. I ordered a cocktail for my app (caesar sallad) and I asked for a glass of red with the steak (NYC sirloin). The app came before the drink. I didnt get the red wine for the steak - I was not billed for it nor did I ask again so maybe I didnt say it clearly enough.

Caesar was okay, nothing special and of course not worth 16 bucks. But hey, its NYC prices.

The NYC Sirloin was super good, but was hard to enjoy at this point as the treatment kind ruined my night. Pricewise it's what you are going to get at this price in NYC.

I payed the bill in full, with 18 or 20% tip and I also tipped the warderobe lady. The service at the table was good.

What ruined my experience completely is that I waited over an hour to be seated when I already had a booking. I have worked many years in the res biz and understand that this happens, how hard is it to try to make up for it? Im not saying giving away free stuff, but atleast you can send a waiter to where im sitting (not the bar but in the bar area) to take a drink order. The staff at the front (not the servers) but what I presume was the maitre d was also quite judgmental and extremeley unprofessional. 

I would just take my money else-where, at this price point there are countless places that will have way better service, and way better food. Obviously nothing changes, as all the reviews complain about the bad front of house.Read more","December 15, 2022"

Deserts were very good too, especially the cheesecake. We also ordered some lattes, which were the best we had during our stay in New York.

We eat here three times in one week. Food was amazing no wonder it’s ranking so high 
We had a different waiter every time all superb 
Just one thing worth mentioning on our last visit we paid by card and ask if we could split the bill 
The waiter took both our card to the till 
Charge me the full amount and my friend half 
When I brought this to his attention he took my card again and charge me the correct amount which was half. I’ve since rang my card provider and they said if it’s not claim in 31 days they will credit it back to meRead more","July 18, 2022"

We were there for New Year’s Eve and our table was under a spotlight which was non-stop flickering the whole time. We understood as it was NYE it would be difficult to reseat us or fix the light however we didn’t expect to have to deal with this in such a highly rated restaurant. 

The service was very attentive, however our waiter had a habit of only speaking to men at the table, which I didn’t appreciate. 

The dumplings were very good I have to say, however I felt massively let down with our steaks. I asked for medium rare however my steak was still practically mooing on the plate. We were also given a giant plate of ketchup which seemed odd and didn’t quite fit the “vibe” of the restaurant. 

We understand some things can’t be helped however our visit wasn’t that impressive.Read more","January 2, 2024"

We had poured over the dry aged steaks on the menu WEEKS before we visited, anxiously studying the menu ahead of time. Upon arrival, there was no delay in being seated at our table. Within minutes we were sipping Manhattans, and other cocktails, deliberating what sides to order with our entrees. The staff was incredibly helpful and friendly. Everyone at our table ordered something very different, but yielded the same result...that this place was incredible. For the next couple hours, we laughed, dined and forgot about everything else in the universe. Gallagher's was that kind of magical dining experience that make you forget about everything outside of its doors. We were full, but we stayed and forged through dessert. After a third hour, we rolled ourselves out the door and back to our hotel, still laughing and talking all the way. It was such a special night of food and fun. We will definitely return again.

For us the food was the let down. We ordered the Calamari (Special) to start to share. The portion was huge but they were tastless and tomato sauce didn't add much.

Our server (I think her name was Nicky) was so helpful and kind and made me feel very welcome and understood which sometimes isn't the case when you ask about allergens. Our waitress gave us lots of recommendations for our steak and sides - we went with what was suggested, and ordered a 10oz steak to share between the two of us (the steak portion looks small in the photos I've shared but that's deceiving, the 5oz was definitely enough!) . We ordered a side of fries and a side of broccoli to share, both were huge. Our server made sure both were cooked in oil and not butter and made sure I had sauce I could use for the fries.

I had the old fashioned, which is a personal favourite of mine, and it was the finest I had ever tasted, and incredibly potent! We didn’t opt for a starter, however the menu doesn’t lack any choices what so ever, the smells coming across the restaurant were out of this world. It is a lively place, engulfed in people laughing and chatting, which I have never had an issue with, apparently others believe it’s to loud which isn’t the case. We opted for some of the steaks on the mains, I had the bone in rib eye, words cannot describe just how magnificent this piece of meat was, cooked to absolute perfection, with a delicious side of Mac and cheese, and serve with a homemade tomato ketchup that I have never tasted, but will never forget. The restaurant itself is lined with photos of some of Americas finest celebrities attending Gallaghers, and for good reason, I’ve been fortunate enough to eat in some of Londons more premier steak venues, however this was a level above, and something I will never forget. Oh, the wine list is absolutely mind blowing as well. Our waiter Nick, has worked here for 34 years, his words, “it’s not a restaurant anymore, it’s an institution” I can’t argue with that in any way. He even bought me a small cake, with a candle after our meal. If you visit New York, then you absolutely have to visit this place, it is a must try!

I almost gave it just 3 stars because of the price of drinks and wine, but since I did have a food credit and many other places similar to this are also just as expensive, I gave it 4.
 This was probably my 3rd or 4th visit over several decades.

I ate on a weekday and there were lots of open spots right at the bar. I had an Old Fashioned, which was $17. I felt the steak prices were just too high, so ordered the less-expensive $38 Double Pork Chop, with a side of $12 green beans and the $21 Escargot appetizer. I looked through their wine list and was shocked at the very high prices, many for what are common grocery store wines, like Meiomi going for $17/ glass!
I had 2 glasses of a nice $22 Merlot, but looking back I probably should have called and seen if they offered corkage and brought my own bottle.

My meal seemed to take a long time to come out. Just as I was inquiring, it appeared and I saw WHY it look so long. The Loin Pork Chop was about 3 inches thick! They gave me a great steak knife to help cut into it and it was very good. I could only finish half of it, so got the rest to go.

My whole meal, with tax and tip came to over $167. Not sure I'd do that if I didn't have a food credit. I'd probably go back, but try one of the entrees, which come with a side, like the salmon or the chicken. And maybe have a drink for free while playing at the slots before dinner!Read more","May 30, 2024"

Got there a bit earlier and sat at the bar. There's something about a steakhouse martini. They really do know how to make it right.
A few minutes before the time of our reservation they offered to sit us. We were led to the main dining room and were seated in a spacious booth. As it was 3 of us i was fearing they would sit us on a small table for two. I was wrong.
We ordered a few appetizers, they were all excellent... clams Casino, clams oreganata, canadian bacon...
Their wine list is extensive but a bit pricey.
For the entree we shared a Tomahawk and a Sirloin, they were both delicious and cooked the exact way we ordered. The creamed spinach was amazing, and so were the other sides we ordered... mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts.
Finally we closed the night with a warm slice of pecan pie, which is one of my favorites. It didn't disappoint.
So even though lately i tend to believe that most steakhouses in NYC are very similar in terms of quality and service Gallagher's is the exemption. It's amongst the top ones for sure. Can't wait to visit again.Read more","August 9, 2024"

In the future I will be avoiding this establishment. It is such a shame that the employees and management are so ignorant because the food truly is great. AVOIDRead more","October 1, 2023"

Even though it was busy and the bar was full, there was never a feeling that you were rushed or that you weren’t important.  We had the seafood tower as an appetizer, which could have been a main course!  Portions are large, tasty and well prepared.  We had a steak and lamb chops.    The total experience was a throwback to a time when service, a knowledgeable waitstaff and an inrushes meal were the order of the day.Read more","June 22, 2023"

I was seated immediately and the service was very attentive. I got the famous sirloin that is aged 28 days (the ones hanging in the window) and I am glad that I did. YUM!  I got the hash brown to go along with it. They serve a fantastic steak sauce to go with the meat and it was amazing as well. A++ all around and I'll be back next time I am in NYC.Read more","January 18, 2022"

My husband had prime rib and I had the 10 ounce filet mignon. It was amazing!!! Cooked to perfection!! We ordered two sides (asparagus and baked potato) and those were delicious as well. Had the cheesecake for dessert and it was so yummy. We sat at the bar and the service was impeccable. I highly recommend this restaurant. We were celebrating our 37th anniversary and we couldn’t have asked or wished for a better meal/experience.Read more,"July 5, 2023"

We made our reservation for dinner last night after having a fabulous experience at Gallaghers 6 months ago. 
Last night the service was downright bad, as was the food. I ordered the lobster. Awhile later, the waiter threw a menu on the table (what the heck), letting us know they were out of lobster. I then ordered a cold 1 lb appetizer lobster, & a dozen oysters. The oysters did not taste good, & the cold lobster tasted like it had been cooked 3 days before…& like it had been sitting in the refrigerator way too long. The other 2  in our party ordered the porterhouse steak, which just wasn’t very good. The new York strip steak section was tough, & just not at all enjoyable. 
Throughout the service was terrible. We almost always tip 25%, & for the first time in my life i tipped 10%. 
What a depressing way to spend $300.00 on our last dinner of our nyc vacation…Read more","July 10, 2023"

The staff was incredibly attentive and kind. They really take their jobs seriously and it shows. The food was excellent and they truly accommodated our requests. We don’t do well with salt but most chefs don’t understand our request for no salt added…but they listened at Gallaghers. We appreciated this meal and will be back soon!Read more","July 12, 2021"

They were a bit concerned that it wouldn't live up to high expectations but couldn't have been more wrong. Clams casino, salmon tartar, bone in filets and  lobster were all well prepared and delicious. Service was professional and we were not rushed which was much appreciated. I didn't think the price was that high considering the quality of food and service. If you order sides they are HUGE. A complimentary dessert was a nice surprise. I can't wait to go back!Read more","July 2, 2023"

From the wood circular front door to the old school service.  Been there with my wife four times in the last two years.  Always dine at the bar as we enjoy the atmosphere and meeting locals and visitors.  Leo, the bartender, is the best! Always welcoming and knows how to provide great service. The drinks and food are plentiful and delicious.  The Clam Casino is not to be missed.  Usually have a filet mignon which is always cooked perfectly medium rare along with hand cut fries.  Always a treat to get hand cut fries these days. Can’t wait to get back again. Read more","October 2, 2023"
